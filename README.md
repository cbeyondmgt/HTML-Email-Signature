# HTML-Email-Signature
HTML email signature with clickable buttons

I decided to do this small project to have a professional looking HTML signature to replace my PNG signature that I had been using. It features a closing statement, graphical signature, profile photo, clickable personal information, and a set of CTA buttons. On mobile clicking the telephone number will initiate a phone call.

I had been working on this template for a day or so and thought I had it dialed in until I became annoyed that it was residing to the far left of the screen. I knew I had to make the code responsive, but I didn't want the graphical elements to scale. I went to my code and separated all of the key components into their own tables and although every email client doesn't yet support FLOATS I decided that it would be a necessary sacrifice in order to keep the code concise and achieve the look I was going for. 

There are some limitations with email that I couldn't get around, such as getting the buttons (tables filled with a color and anchor links with large padding and background color) to be the exact size that I wanted and the closing/signature combo aligning correctly on every device. 

I plan on researching media queries further to see their current compatibility, but overall I'm happy with the outcome.
